### Stack Data Structure

A stack is a type of linear data structure where elements are added or removed from one specific end, often referred to as the "top". This behavior is similar to a stack of books, where a new book can only be added to the top of the stack, and the only book that can be removed is the one on the top.

Stacks are also known as a "First In, Last Out" (FILO) data structure. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. In contrast, a queue is an example of a "First In, First Out" (FIFO) data structure, where the first element added is also the first one to be removed.

A real-world example of a stack in computing is the back/forward function in a web browser. This function allows users to navigate through previously visited web pages, where each page is added and removed from a stack data structure.

## Methods

Stacks offer three methods for interaction, which are:

- Push: adds data to the top of the stack
- Pop: returns and eliminates data from the top of the stack
- Peek: retrieves data from the top of the stack without removing it
